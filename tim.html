    <h5>
        I grew up in southern California and moved to Idaho when I graduated from high school.
        A year after moving I heard of an increadibly interesting degree called GIMM.
        After startingting the program I developed an great love for video game design and the puzzle solving of coding.
        I am currently developing my own VR game and exploring the multitude of possibilities the VR open up.
