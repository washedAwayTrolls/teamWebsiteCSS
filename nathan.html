    <hr>
    <p class="blueBackground">I grew up in a small Idaho town and fell in love with video games at a young age. 
        Nintendo games and flash games were my bread and butter in my early years, and
        those games inspired me to try and make my own. I also really like studying insects
        and writing fiction and screenplays.

    <h2>Short story I wrote in Freshman year of high school called "Rolasia's Devious Descent"</h2>
    <p>
        Rolasia's Devious Descent
 
The poorly treated outcasts had enough of accepting their people’s racist ways. The stone city of Rolasia, set in a medieval fantasy, sprouted large towers that intimidated the mistreated race. Ira had enough of their unethical system. He had finally prepared a group of his race to infiltrate the wealthy king and his triumphant castle. A well-built stone wall surrounded the kingdom and kept in the accepted individuals. Rolasia’s immaculate wall represented the border between the fair elves, and the unfortunate dark elves. Outside of the kingdom’s barrier lived the dark elves, suffering the unending work to serve their brothers, while they received little.
           “We’re almost there,” said Ira. His companions faced him to listen to further directions.
            “I’m sorry, where are we again?” Lumbert questioned, scratching his bulky head.
            Ira gave Lumbert an angry glare. “For the third time, we are in the sewers under Rolasia, and we are getting close to the king’s castle,” Ira whispered, irritated by Lumbert’s incompetence.
Lumbert clenched his nose from the foul smell. He bent his head to keep from hitting it on the cold, wet roof.
            A womanly shadow lurked behind them and grabbed Ira’s boney shoulder. Ira spun around quickly and realized that the figure was Virsha, a dark elf friend who was aiding his side to fulfill his righteous plan.
            “Virsha!” whispered Ira. “You startled me.”
            Virsha’s light voice responded, “Sorry about that, but you should be prepared for anything.”
            The other two members of Ira’s crew, Trevo and Uvgar, couldn’t take their eyes off of Virsha’s undoubted beauty.
            Virsha caught their staring and cursed at them, “Trevo! Uvgar! Pay attention to the plan at hand!”
            Ira whispered, “Virsha! Keep your voice down, we could get caught.”
Virsha crossed her skinny arms and faced away from Ira, “Fine.”
            Ira began to slosh down the murky, cramped tunnel. Sewer water went up to Ira’s ankles and soaked his baggy pants.
Ira was a skinny dark elf, with a long sword sheathed on his belt. Dark spiky hair rose up several inches from his skull. Pitch black circles covered most of Ira’s small eyes. Ira’s courageous nature kept him moving forward, no matter what obstacle he encountered.
            Lumbert followed behind Ira, slightly tripping along the way. The only reason Ira accepted Lumbert into his crew was because of his brute strength. No other dark elf was as tenacious and brainless as Lumbert.
Trevo and Uvgar eventually took their eyes off of Virsha and started to trudge behind Ira, occasionally glancing over their shoulders to view her. These dark elves were similar in physical form and look, and it’s no surprise they are twins. Both Trevo and Uvgar were stubby and lack the ability to run without stumbling.
            Virsha followed far behind the group, appearing mysterious and intimidating. This female dark elf had long black hair that flowed down her back. Virsha concealed numerous daggers in hidden places in and out of her clothes. Piercing dark purple eyes almost never seemed to blink.
            After only a couple of minutes, the group had reached the castle, under the castle in a sewer that is.
Light shined through the manhole cover which hurt the dark elves’ sensitive eyes. Dark elves were built to see in the dark and avoid the sun.
            Ira was given many worried looks, “Alright guys, you ready?”
            Lumbert’s face turned confused, “Uh, boss. What exactly are we doing?”
            Ira angrily muttered, “For the last time Lumbert, we are overthrowing the king. We will make him pay for his crimes against us.” Ira took a breath then said, “I’m going up, follow behind me.” The other elves nodded.
            Before Ira had a chance to climb up, Virsha interrupted, “Ira… I have a different plan.”
            “Huh?” Ira tilted his head. “What? What is it?”
            Virsha smirked, “I have heard of a talisman that the king is keeping locked away. It is worth more gold than you could imagine.” She continued, “I have even heard that this treasure can grant wishes.”
            Everyone took it as a joke and started quietly laughing to themselves, except for Ira. He turned to face Virsha, “Even if all you said was true, how could we get our boney hands on it? And also, how is this going to help us overthrow the king?” Ira had a good point, their plan is to get revenge on the king, not steal and become rich.
            Virsha grinned even more, “The king keeps it in his dungeon, which is where this manhole leads up to. All we need is a key, or… a lock pick. Once we get hold of its power, wishing away the king will be an easy task.” Virsha took out a lock pick from her leather satchel, “We can get it, but we can’t be caught. Or there will be consequences.”
            The dark elf crew became excited for their prize so close in reach. Ira placed a hand on the ladder up. “Well then, what are we waiting for? Let’s go get this talisman.”
            Ira went up the mossy ladder and pushed open the manhole cover, “It’s safe; there is no one in sight.” He slid the cover out of the way and leaped up inside. The king’s dungeon was dark, with few torches dimly lighting up with the only purpose to scare trespassers. Cobwebs spread in every corner and dust floated leisurely across the room. Ira could see the dark room perfectly fine; their race has incredible eyesight in the dark.
            Lumbert followed right behind Ira, and after came the three others. A golden chest lay on the side of the wall. An extravagant keyhole bore into the middle of the chest. Virsha tip-toed up to the chest and started her pick locking procedure. After only two minutes she had broken the lock. The chest opened by itself. Everyone leaned over and peered inside at the same time. A massive sabre cat tooth sat in the middle of the chest.
            Ira questioned Virsha, “Are you sure this tooth can make wishes? I’m not even sure if it’s worth very much.”
Virsha picked up the tooth, her eyes dilated at the sight of her new attained treasure. Out of nowhere, footsteps roared down a set of stairs, and before the dark elves knew it, a swarm of armored elf guards had caught them in the act. The leader of the guards spoke, “Hah, caught you in the act, you filthy scum!” He ripped the sabre cat tooth out from Virsha's brittle hand. One by one, each one of the members were hit in the head by the handle of a mace, enough to knock them out.
            Ira woke up on a frigid, stone floor. They had been thrown in a cell. Many metal bars were vertically placed, only two inches apart from each other. His head ached from the quick beating he took. Virsha, Lumbert, Trevo, and Uvgar woke up at the same time as Ira. Everyone gave each other a disappointing look.
            Virsha spoke with a low tone, “I’m sorry guys. I should have seen them coming.”
Ira looked down at the ground. “It’s fine Virsha, it was worth a shot. I just wish they didn’t take that tooth away from us.”
Virsha rose up from the stone, “But, it’s not over yet.” The group had their attention caught instantly by Virsha. She pulled out the talisman.
            “What!?” Yelled Ira, “How did you get it back?”
Everyone's eyes and mouths widened.
Virsha responded, “I switched the real one out for a fake, and they took the bait.”
            The dark elves cheered quietly. “You are brilliant!” said Trevo and Uvgar simultaneously.
            Ira questioned, “Now exactly how many wishes do we get?”
The female dark elf answered, “This tooth lets us wish three wishes.” Virsha then gleefully exclaimed, “Now what are we going to wish for?”
Ira rubbed his black hands up and down in an evil manor. “We wish for the king's death!”
All of the dark elves cheered loudly as a guard walked past them.
The well-armored guard turned to face them and asked, “Did I hear what I think I just heard?” Their laughter paused, and they stared at the guard, feeling revealed.
“Please! Please don't tell the other guards!” Lumbert begged.
The guard raised his chin. “Too late, you criminal scum. I'm heading over to tell them immediately.”
Ira screamed, “No!” as he snatched the special tooth out of Virsha's hand. He rose the talisman up in the air and wished, “I wish that the guard who heard our secret couldn't speak!”
The guard raised an eyebrow and then realized the object Ira held. At the same time, both Trevo and Uvgar gasped and placed their hand over their mouth.
The guard angrily exclaimed, “You treacherous bast-!” The guard's explicit language suddenly stopped as his mouth closed shut; the bars of the cell twisted and wrapped around his lips.
Screaming mumbles could be heard. The guard’s shocked eyes stared down at his sealed lips.
Lumbert almost fainted from the unholy sight. Ira and Virsha realized the dark and twisted mind the talisman held. The gray bars slowly turned red, trickling down. The guard shut his eyes and fell dead with his mouth still caught.
“I- “ Ira stuttered, “I didn't think it would do that...!”
Virsha swallowed her fear, “Who cares... he deserves it. He has tortured so many of ours that this doesn't even get close to what he deserves.”
Lumbert spoke out, “But… he was just following orders. I thought it was the king doing wrong.”
Everyone turned their heads and ignored the truth.
 “Let's carry on.” Virsha said, “We need to advance our race over theirs.”
“You're right.” Said Ira, “I'm going to wish and end their reign once and for all.”
Once again, Ira raised the stolen talisman into the air, clenching his fist around it.
His wish was interrupted when he realized the king of Rolasia was standing right outside their cell. The king wore a red robe and a tall, golden crown.
He gave them a distressed look and spoke in a rough voice, “What have you done?”
“What do you mean?” asked Ira. “We are ending your racist ways! You have treated us poorly for generations! We have had enough!”
Ira had spat over the king's healthy face.
The king looked Ira in his dark eyes, “Please. Don't use it anymore. I should have destroyed it years ago.”
Ira began to feel furious, “King! You will pay for your unjustified doings! Your devious lies won't keep me from stopping you!”
The other dark elves encouraged him, “Ira! Do it! Wish your next wish!”
Ira rose up his clenched fist and wished, “I wish that the dark elves of Rolasia rose up over the white-skinned elves!”
The king shook his head in fear, “No! I must get out of here!”
He sprinted away as loud commotion could be heard throughout the castle. Ira, Lumbert, Virsha, Trevo, and Uvgar could hear bloody war cries coming from outside their cell. A group of bloodthirsty dark elves barbarically stomped down the castle hall. Dark red blood covered some of the warriors from head to toe.
The dark elf warriors noticed their captured friends and used their brute strength to free them from the bars.
The most muscled warrior grabbed onto Ira's hand. “Join us. Take these swords, all of you. And fight! Fight for our freedom!”
Ira and his group turned their heads to one another and nodded confidently. They gripped the swords and ran with the crowd of dark elves. Neither Ira nor Lumbert had ever killed another elf, and this was their first time. Ira and Lumbert struck their swords into helpless elves. Blood flew everywhere in all directions. Ira and Lumbert had never felt so alive; they had been consumed by the rush of war.
They exited the king's castle and went on a rampage, burning and destroying every well-built structure the elves owned. Fire blazed through the night with screams alongside it. Virsha stealthily backstabbed every citizen she saw. Trevo and Uvgar used their identical attacking moves to easily defeat any elf that fought back. The pale elves didn’t stand a chance.
Throughout the horrendous bloodshed, Ira spotted the king escaping and sprinting out of the kingdom.
“Virsha!” Ira yelled, “The king is escaping! Capture him!”
It only took Virsha a minute to track down the king and tie him up.
The killing had stopped; every last white-skinned elf was murdered. The dark elves cheered and celebrated their rightful victory.
Ira traveled back to the castle with the hundreds of dark elves who followed him. Virsha tagged along with the king's wrists tied behind his back.
After returning back to the king's castle, the many dark elves asked out loud, “Who was it that helped us overcome the king? Who enabled us to fulfill our wanted dreams?”
Virsha spoke out loud with the king on his knees beside her, “It was Ira! He was the dark elf that ended the king's long reign!”
The massive crowd of dark elves cheered.
Virsha continued, “He is our new leader! Our new savior!”
The crowd cheered even louder.
Virsha took the king's crown from his head and walked over to Ira. “Sit.” Virsha said, “Sit down on your rightfully owned throne. You are our new leader, Ira.”
Virsha gently placed the golden crown on top of Ira's head. A rush of power surged through Ira's new body.
Adrenaline rushed through Ira’s body as he caught a devious act in the corner of his eye. The king was freeing himself by cutting his rope!
Virsha screamed, “Hey! That's my dagger!” She rushed over to the king by the time he had already freed himself. Virsha pounced at the king, but it backfired, and the king cleverly spun her around. He placed the dagger at her throat and pressed.
“No! Leave her be!” demanded Ira.
The king grinned with yellow teeth, “Don't do anything! If you place ONE foot towards me, her throat is getting slit.”
 Ira gulped and froze. No one said a word.
Ira spoke out into the crowd of dark elves, “People! Do not attack the king. Virsha is too precious to me.”
Virsha had just discovered she had feelings for Ira.
The grinning king spoke again, “Now you are going to let me get out of here, or your girl is dead.”
Ira felt angry. In the back of Ira's mind he knew he couldn't let the king go, he needed to be dead for his wrong doings. Then he remembered...
“Silly king,” Ira said. “You are a fool.” Ira raised the sabre cat tooth and wished out loud, “I wish for the king to be dead.” Ira expected fear to strike the king's face, but instead a slight smirk appeared.
The king stared at Ira and said, “This time, Ira. You... are the fool.”
Once Ira realized his mistake, he felt his throat being constricted. The sabre cat tooth wrapped around his neck like a snake, squeezing tighter and tighter to the point Ira couldn't breathe. Ira turned pale and fell to the ground, and with the last few seconds of consciousness, he heard the screams of Virsha as her neck was slit by her own dagger. An angry frown grew larger on Ira’s face as he watched the king escape over the wall, and the dark elves so distracted, they didn't even notice. He was the king. He was the new king. And he had wished his own death. Ira's eyes shut with the last glimpse of his fellow companions, aiding his side, and turned away from the escaping king.
